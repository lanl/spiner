![Build Status](https://github.com/LANL/spiner/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

Performance portable utilities for representing and interpolating
tabulated data. Named for [Brent
Spiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Spiner).

## Performance portability

`Spiner` is compatible with code on CPU, GPU, and everything in between. Read the `ports-of-call` [README](ports-of-call/README.md) for more details.

## Building and Installation

`Spiner` is self-contained. Simply clone it as
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.lanl.gov:jonahm/spiner.git
```
To build and run unit tests,
```bash
mkdir bin
cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..
make -j
make test
```
and to do convergence testing,
```bash
make convergence
```
after building.

To install,
```bash
make install
```
after configuring and building.

### Build options

- `SPINER_USE_HDF` enables or disables HDF5. Default is `OFF`
- `SPINER_USE_KOKKOS` enables or disables Kokkos. Default is `OFF`.
- `SPINER_USE_CUDA` enables or disables Cuda. Requires Kokkos. Default is `OFF`.
- `BUILD_TESTING` enables or disables tests. Default is `OFF`. If
  this is disabled, then configuration *only* prepares for install and
  provides targets for in-tree builds, as no build step is necessary.
- `SPINER_HDF5_INSTALL_DIR` a hint for cmake about where you may have stashed HDF5.
- `SPINER_KOKKOS_INSTALL_DIR` a hint for cmake about where you may have stashed Kokkos.

## Including spiner in your project

You can build `spiner` in-line with your project, or pre-install
it. It's header-only and the include directories should have the
expected structure. If you build inline, add the following targets to your `cmake`:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE spiner::flags spiner::libs)
```
`spiner::flags` contains compile and include flags, to be included at
compile lines. `spiner::libs` contains linker flags. Since `spiner` is
header-only, `spiner::libs` only contains link flags for dependencies,
such as `HDF5` or `Kokkos`.

For access to both, use
```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE spiner::spiner)
```

## Dependencies

`Spiner` has no dependencies for the `databox` tool. Simply include it in your project under the `spiner` directory. It is header-only and requires only a few files:

- `spiner/databox.hpp`
- `spiner/interpolation.hpp`
- `spiner/spiner_types.hpp`
- `spiner/sp5.hpp`
- `ports-of-call/portability.hpp`
- `ports-of-call/portable_arrays.hpp`

To use the build system (rather than simply cloning and including the files) requires `cmake`.

The testing tooling requires a few different pieces:

- Unit testing requires [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2),
  which is downloaded automatically if needed.
- Convergence testing requires the scientific python stack, including:
  - python3
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

### HDF5

`Spiner` supports reading and writing DataBox objects into a custom HDF5 format called `SP5`. 
To enable this, compile with the appropriate `HDF5` linking and the flag `-DSPINER_USE_HDF`.
If you use the cmake build system, just configure with `-DSPINER_USE_HDF=ON`.

### CUDA and Kokkos

`Spiner` uses the `ports-of-call` code to optionally support
compilation with CUDA, Kokkos, or none of the above. If `Kokkos` is
discoverable by cmake (for example if you installed it with `spack`),
then the build system should find it automatically. Otherwise you can
specify a location for Kokkos with `SPINER_KOKKOS_INSTALL_DIR`. 

The following spack install was tested with a V100 GPU:
```bash
spack install kokkos-nvcc-wrapper
spack install kokkos~shared+cuda+cuda_lambda+cuda_relocatable_device_code+wrapper cuda_arch=70
```
and then the following cmake configuration line
```C++
cmake -DSPINER_USE_KOKKOS=ON -DSPINER_USE_CUDA=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=nvcc_wrapper ..
```
builds the tests for CUDA.

### Clang-Format

Clang-format version 12 is required for committing, and a github
workflow is used to check that code meets format requirements. We
provide a make target in the build system. After configuration, simply
type
```bash
make format
```
to format the code.

Other versions of `clang-format` may work. If you would like to try,
please examine the diff and see if the formatting appears
stable. Otherwise, you may need to upgrade your version of
`clang-format`.

In general, we recommend formatting regularly so that the format calls
do not pollute the diffs. If a format call necessarily pollutes the
diff, do it as a separate commit.

## Features

- Spiner supports interpolation in arbitrary dimensions, and it's fast in 3d and fewer.
- Spiner supports interpolation onto "subtables"

## Interpolation

Interpolation is linear. Here's an example of interpolation in 3D (2D
slice shown). Convergence is second-order, as expected.
